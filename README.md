# GitHub Composite Actions for NubesGen

This repository contains [GitHub Composite Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) that are used by the [https://nubesgen.com/](https://nubesgen.com/) project, when using a GitOps approach.

Those Composite Actions allow to configure more easily CI/CD pipelines that will apply infrastructure configuration (using an Infrastrucutre-as-Code tool like Terraform), build the project, and deploy it to the cloud infrastructure.
